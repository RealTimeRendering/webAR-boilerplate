<!--

This is the standard ThreeJS-based boilerplate for webAR
	currently being used by the eleVR team.

This requires the use of a smartphone with webGL and a reflecting pass-through AR headset. Otherwise, everything will appear reversed.

This boilerplate is based on Mozilla's boilerplate: https://github.com/MozVR/ar-web-examples/tree/master/threejs-ar-boilerplate

It has been developed with the help of a great many people including (but not limited to) Vi Hart, Andrew Lutomirski, Henry Segerman, and the Firefox webVR team.
